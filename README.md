# Stock-price-prediction-Neural-Network
As a recent student in applied Artificial Intelligence, I am trying to learn practical AI by attempting to create a NN  that can predict the Stock price of some stocks using news and historical price. The idea is to do sentiment analysis on news article and train the Network with the sentiment scores as inputs. 
This is a module in my study course so I will not be trying to actually profit from this system and will just take it as a learning experience.
